# WebHookProxy Saas

## Introduction

This is the SaaS multi-tenant bootstrapper for the core [webhookproxy](http://www.github.com/nowprovision/webhookproxy) backend library.

This pulls web hook data from a postgres database, monitors for updates, additions and deletions (the latter two in progress) 
and updates handlers in real-time. 

This powers the free SaaS at https://www.webhookproxy.com

## Disclaimer

A lot of stuff isn't optimal, I am well aware. Minimal viable product and all that malarkey. 

PR welcomes, contributions will be noted
